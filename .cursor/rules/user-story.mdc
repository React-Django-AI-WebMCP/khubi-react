As a **<user role>**,
I want **<visible interaction>**,
so that **<user benefit>**.

**Design Reference**

- Visual state matches design (including all UI elements from Epic/UI Map, even if non-functional)
- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <edge case or rule>

**Visual Structure Reference**

- UI Map specifies: <list key visual elements from UI Map>
- **Note**: Visual elements should be present even if functionality is in another story (mark as disabled/display-only)

- Interaction works as described
- No unresolved assumptions
