### Scope
- Implement Angular frontend strictly as per the approved technical contract
- No deviation from API, models, or behavior defined in the contract
- **CRITICAL**: Implement all visual structure specified in contract (columns, buttons, icons, formatting)
- **CRITICAL**: Include display-only elements (disabled/non-functional) if specified in contract

### References
- Contract Link: <link>
- Design (Figma): <link> 

### Rules
- Do NOT modify the contract
- Create subtasks ONLY by responsibility, never by UI component.
- Do NOT invent business rules
- All UI components belong to the SAME FE subtask.
- If work seems large, it remains ONE subtask unless the STORY itself is split.
- Maximum subtasks per story: 3
- Start title with [FE] for frontend [BE] for backend & database
- NEVER create subtasks for:
   - Individual components
   - Pages
   - UI sections
   - Buttons, modals, tooltips, etc.
- Do NOT add or change APIs
-  Allowed subtask types:
   - ONE Frontend subtask(If needed)
   - ONE Backend subtask(If needed)
   - ONE Database subtask (only if schema changes exist)
### Done When
- React code matches the contract
- All required states handled (loading, empty, error)
- **Visual structure matches contract** (all columns, buttons, icons, formatting as specified)
- **Display-only elements** are present but disabled (if specified in contract)
- Unit tests added
